Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take many forms.

There are two concepts in methods in Java.
1) Overriding
2) Overloading

If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

In native language.
Declared in parent class and using in child class is known as overriding.

Declared in parent class and write methods in it itself is known as overloading.
